# meow-rs Roadmap

Owner: pm
Last updated: 2026-05-13 (audit — reconcile M2 item 6 [release CI, done via release.yml] and M1.H-2 [Prometheus /metrics, dropped 2026-04-19]; cite primary landing commits where the prior audit only cited follow-ups. Still open: M1.E-6, M1.F-4/5, the Go-vs-Rust shared-hw benchmark publication, and M3.)
Source inputs: `docs/vision.md`, `docs/gap-analysis.md`, `docs/ci-status.md`.

This roadmap translates the architect's gap analysis into an ordered work
program. Milestones mirror `docs/vision.md`; items inside each milestone are
ordered by **user-visible value per unit of risk**. Anything marked
*excluded* in `docs/vision.md` §Non-goals is intentionally absent.

Legend for each work item:

- **Value**: H/M/L — how many real subscriptions / deployments it unblocks.
- **Risk**: H/M/L — implementation complexity, crypto surface, or blast
  radius on the hot path.
- **Spec**: link to `docs/specs/<feature>.md` once drafted (PM owns).
- **Owner**: engineer handoff target.

## M0 — Correctness cleanup (do first, in parallel with M1)

Small, bounded items surfaced in `gap-analysis.md` §7. Each is a reliability
or security regression vs upstream; none needs a full spec. Engineer can
pick these up as "fix-it Fridays" while larger M1 specs are drafted.

| # | Item | Value | Risk | Notes |
|---|------|:-----:|:----:|-------|
| ~~M0-1~~ | ~~Enforce REST API `secret` (Bearer auth)~~ | H | L | ~~`AppState.secret` is `#[allow(dead_code)]`; unauth API is a security gap~~ *(landed in [d89e5fd](../../../commit/d89e5fd); hardened to constant-time compare in [178c30f](../../../commit/178c30f); upstream-parity refinements in [3b84db2](../../../commit/3b84db2))* |
| ~~M0-2~~ | ~~Replace `eprintln!` debug in `routes.rs:115` with `tracing::debug!`~~ | L | L | ~~Hot-path log spam~~ *(closed: no `eprintln!` left in `meow-api`; routes.rs has been rewritten)* |
| ~~M0-3~~ | ~~Wire `PROCESS-NAME` lookup (netlink on Linux, `libproc` on macOS)~~ | M | M | ~~Currently a no-op `Box<dyn Fn()>`; rules silently never match~~ *(merged [d89e5fd](../../../commit/d89e5fd))* |
| ~~M0-4~~ | ~~GEOIP parser + shared `Arc<MaxMindDB>` plumbing~~ | H | M | ~~Today `parse_rule` rejects `GEOIP`; YAML with GEOIP fails to load~~ *(merged [d89e5fd](../../../commit/d89e5fd))* |
| ~~M0-5~~ | ~~Populate `Resolver` hosts trie from `dns.hosts` config~~ | M | L | ~~Trie allocated, never filled~~ *(merged [d89e5fd](../../../commit/d89e5fd); superseded by M1.E-5 for remaining gaps)* |
| ~~M0-6~~ | ~~Wire DNS in-flight dedup (`inflight: DashMap`)~~ | M | L | ~~Allocated but `#[allow(dead_code)]`~~ *(closed: `Resolver::lookup` now uses the inflight map; covered by `inflight_entry_cleared_after_lookup_miss` in `meow-dns/src/resolver.rs`)* |
| ~~M0-7~~ | ~~Verify `AND/OR/NOT` logic rules reachable from top-level parser~~ | M | L | ~~`logic.rs` exists; confirm dispatch, add tests~~ *(confirmed + tested in [8924d49](../../../commit/8924d49))* |
| ~~M0-8~~ | ~~Prune dead `AdapterType` variants (or mark `#[doc(hidden)]`)~~ | L | L | ~~`RejectDrop`, `Compatible`, `Pass`, `Dns`, `Relay`, `LoadBalance`, unimplemented protos~~ *(merged [3599bdb](../../../commit/3599bdb))* |
| ~~M0-9~~ | ~~Drop or implement `rule-providers.interval` periodic refresh~~ | M | L | ~~Field accepted and ignored today~~ *(superseded by M1.D-5)* |
| ~~M0-10~~ | ~~CI P0: wire `v2ray_plugin_integration` + `pre_resolve_test` into `test.yml`~~ | H | L | ~~Tests exist but are not gated (see `ci-status.md` §Gaps P0)~~ *(merged [6b9af50](../../../commit/6b9af50))* |

Exit criteria: every item closed or converted into a tracked issue with a
clear decision (implement / defer / remove).

## M1 — Parity for the common user

Goal from `vision.md`: a typical Clash Meta user's subscription loads and
routes correctly on meow-rs. Priority is breadth over polish.

### M1.A — Reusable transports (prereq)

Before VMess/VLESS land we need transports as composable layers, not
bespoke code glued into a single adapter. Today `ws` and `tls` live inside
`v2ray_plugin.rs` / `trojan.rs`. Architecture is settled in
[ADR-0001](adr/0001-meow-transport-crate.md): new `meow-transport`
leaf crate; `Transport` trait with `connect(Box<dyn Stream>) -> Box<dyn
Stream>`; five initial layers (tls / ws / grpc / h2 / httpupgrade), each
behind a Cargo feature.

**gRPC decision (2026-04-11):** hand-roll the "gun" framing on top of the
`h2` crate — **no tonic, no prost**. Upstream `transport/gun/gun.go` has
no protobuf schema; "gRPC transport" is just HTTP/2 tunnelling with a
fake `content-type: application/grpc` header. Tonic would pull ~30
crates for zero code-gen value.

**Engineer build sequence** (baked into ADR-0001 §Build sequence — specs
below must not reorder without architect sign-off):

1. M1.A-1 — crate skeleton + `Transport` trait + `tls` layer; migrate `trojan.rs`.
2. M1.A-2 — `ws` layer (with early-data header); migrate `v2ray_plugin.rs`.
3. **VMess (M1.B-1) unblocks here** — only needs `tls + ws`.
4. M1.A-3 — `grpc` (hand-rolled gun) layer.
5. M1.A-4 — `h2` + `httpupgrade` layers.

| # | Item | Value | Risk | Spec | Owner |
|---|------|:-----:|:----:|------|-------|
| ~~M1.A-1~~ | ~~`meow-transport` crate skeleton + `Transport` trait + `tls` layer + `trojan.rs` migration~~ | H | M | ~~[`docs/specs/transport-layer.md`](specs/transport-layer.md)~~ *(merged [e87d570](../../../commit/e87d570))* | ~~engineer~~ |
| ~~M1.A-2~~ | ~~`ws` layer + `v2ray_plugin.rs` migration (same spec)~~ | H | M | ~~same spec, §M1.A-2~~ *(merged [e87d570](../../../commit/e87d570))* | ~~engineer~~ |
| ~~M1.A-3~~ | ~~`grpc` (hand-rolled gun over `h2`) layer (same spec)~~ | H | M | ~~same spec, §M1.A-3~~ *(merged [df78968](../../../commit/df78968))* | ~~engineer~~ |
| ~~M1.A-4~~ | ~~`h2` + `httpupgrade` layers (same spec)~~ | M | M | ~~same spec, §M1.A-4~~ *(merged [df78968](../../../commit/df78968))* | ~~engineer~~ |

All four steps are covered by a single spec (`docs/specs/transport-layer.md`)
because ADR-0001 already settled the architecture — the spec only fills in
YAML schema, struct shapes, error types, and per-layer tests.

### M1.B — Outbound protocols

**VLESS is the primary modern outbound for M1.** VMess is dropped — see note below.

| # | Item | Value | Risk | Spec | Owner |
|---|------|:-----:|:----:|------|-------|
| ~~M1.B-1~~ | ~~VMess outbound~~ | — | — | [`docs/specs/proxy-vmess.md`](specs/proxy-vmess.md) *(dropped 2026-04-11 — preserved as design record)* | — |
| ~~M1.B-2~~ | ~~VLESS outbound (plain, XTLS-vision optional)~~ | H | H | ~~[`docs/specs/proxy-vless.md`](specs/proxy-vless.md)~~ *(merged [334d55c](../../../commit/334d55c))* | ~~engineer~~ |
| ~~M1.B-3~~ | ~~HTTP CONNECT outbound~~ | M | L | ~~[`docs/specs/proxy-http-socks-outbound.md`](specs/proxy-http-socks-outbound.md)~~ *(merged [df78968](../../../commit/df78968))* | ~~engineer~~ |
| ~~M1.B-4~~ | ~~SOCKS5 outbound~~ | M | L | ~~same spec, §SOCKS5~~ *(merged [df78968](../../../commit/df78968))* | ~~engineer~~ |

**VMess drop rationale (2026-04-11):** most modern users have migrated to VLESS.
VMess adds significant protocol complexity (AEAD KDF, auth-id replay cache, legacy
cipher quirks, `vmess-legacy` feature flag) for diminishing returns. Dropped from
M1 scope; spec preserved in `docs/specs/proxy-vmess.md` as a design record if
revisited in a future milestone.

**`connect_over` trait status (updated 2026-04-18):** `ProxyAdapter::connect_over`
is fully implemented and merged for HTTP CONNECT + SOCKS5 (df78968). VLESS
has its own `connect_over` override in 334d55c. All B items are on main.

**Deferred to M1.5 / M2** (architect recommendation, 2026-04-11):

- **Hysteria2** — `quinn` pulls a sizable QUIC dep tree; footprint goal in
  `vision.md` makes it a poor fit for M1. Revisit after the M2 footprint
  audit so we know the cost. Same logic applies to TUIC and any other
  QUIC-based protocol.
- **Reality transport** (pairs with VLESS but is its own large spec).
- **WireGuard, Snell, SSH** — niche/legacy.

### M1 exit criteria (revised 2026-04-11)

- All M1.A–H specs implemented and merged on main.
- All M1 test plans pass under `cargo test` (lib + integration).
- Workspace builds clean on Ubuntu + macOS CI (current).
- Manual smoke test by the operator with one real Clash Meta subscription,
  running ≥ 1 hour, routing observable real traffic without panics or
  functional regressions.
- CI green on main for at least the 24 hours preceding the release tag.

**Rationale for revised criteria:** the "24h automated soak under synthetic
load" (task #25) is dropped in favour of a short manual smoke under real
protocol load. Real-protocol coverage is gained at near-zero tooling cost;
slow-leak detection moves to M2 profiling if ever needed.

## M2 — Performance and footprint

Scope frozen after M1 lands. Status as of 2026-04-25:

1. ~~`geodata:` YAML subsection (`mmdb-path`, `asn-path`, `geosite-path`, `auto-update`, `url.*`) — [`docs/specs/geodata-subsection.md`](specs/geodata-subsection.md).~~ *(merged [db5228f](../../../commit/db5228f) — M2.A)*
2. ~~Benchmark harness vs Go mihomo on identical hardware — `docs/benchmarks/`.~~ *(merged [9754bdc](../../../commit/9754bdc) criterion harness; [3d3b179](../../../commit/3d3b179) DNS QPS + 10k-rule extension — M2.B)*
3. ~~Allocator audit of TCP relay and UDP NAT hot paths.~~ *(merged [a4058af](../../../commit/a4058af) zero-alloc UDP NAT; [f191272](../../../commit/f191272) trie early-exit + skip-domain scan — M2.D; [2ceebeb](../../../commit/2ceebeb) reverted mimalloc back to system allocator)*
4. ~~Cargo feature flags for every optional protocol/transport; minimal-build size budget for `aarch64-musl` and `mipsel-musl`.~~ *(merged [f249a56](../../../commit/f249a56) feature flags + size budget; [10e570c](../../../commit/10e570c) `panic=abort`; [b377939](../../../commit/b377939) `opt-level=z` — M2.E; aarch64 minimal 9.5 → 5.x MB)*
5. ~~Rule-engine micro-optimizations (trie layout, IP-CIDR structure).~~ *(merged with M2.D in [f191272](../../../commit/f191272))*
6. ~~Release CI — prebuilt static binaries per `ci-status.md` P1 item 5.~~ *(closed: `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` via `cargo-zigbuild` on `v*` tag pushes, with sha256 sidecars and `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` publication; see `docs/ci-status.md` §release.yml and Gap-5 resolution)*
7. ~~MSRV pin, `cargo audit` cron, `cargo doc` check, `cargo hack --feature-powerset`, coverage upload.~~ *(merged [9dd952f](../../../commit/9dd952f) / [280876f](../../../commit/280876f) — M2.F; macOS CI was already on)*

Exit criteria: measurably lower CPU and RSS than Go mihomo on a shared
benchmark, minimal-build binary under stated size budget. **Bench numbers
are now produced by the criterion harness; an exit comparison vs Go mihomo
on shared hardware still needs to be published before declaring M2 done.**

**Still open in M2:** the published Go-vs-Rust benchmark comparison on
the reference Linux bench host (per ADR-0006 §3 "exactly one machine, the
canonical baseline"). Local-scope verification on macOS is captured in
[`docs/benchmarks/m2-exit-local.md`](benchmarks/m2-exit-local.md) and the
preliminary status in
[`docs/benchmarks/m2-exit-status-preliminary.md`](benchmarks/m2-exit-status-preliminary.md);
the final aggregate (`m2-exit-summary.md`) lands once the reference-host
W1–W5 runs are published.

---

## M3 — Operational maturity

Scope per `vision.md` §M3. Specs drafted only after M2 exit:

- Hot config reload without dropping connections where safe.
- OpenTelemetry trace/metric export (opt-in).
- `meow check` CLI with actionable errors + schema export.
- Subscription robustness: retry/backoff, signed subscriptions.
- API auth hardening: per-endpoint authz, audit log for mutating calls.
- Documented config-compat policy across releases.

## How this doc is maintained

- PM owns ordering, value/risk grades, and the "spec exists yet?" column.
- Adding a new item requires a one-line justification in the PR that
  updates this file.
- When an item lands, strike it through and link the merged PR; do not
  delete rows until the next milestone rollover — the history is useful.
- Items move *between* milestones only on architect or team-lead sign-off.
- Scope changes that reintroduce a `vision.md` §Non-goals item require
  explicit product approval in the commit message.
